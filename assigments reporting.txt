1.2 a) The point estimate is represented by the sample proportion of working parents who receives childcare benefit which is 0.7. 
1.2 b) The 99% confidence interval for the population proportion is [0.6166, 0.7834]
1.3 c) The null hypothesis is: “The proportion of parents who receive child care benefit is equal to 75 percent.” The alternative hypothesis is: “The proportion of parents who receive child care benefits is not equal to 75 percent.”
alpha = 0.1

We choose to perform Z-test proportion test with 0.75 since we have a sufficient sample size. The Z-test statistic is found to be -1.663. This value lies between the two critical values −1.96 and 1.96 
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level that the true proportion of working parents receiving childcare benefit differs from 75%.
The p-value remains the same regardless of the chosen alpha. However, the decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis might change based on the chosen alpha.



1.4 a)


We are comparing proportions of word counts across different novels by the same or different authors, to see if the distribution of word counts is consistent across these novels.
This makes the Homogeinity test the most suitable.


1.4 b)


Test for Austen's novels:

        Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  austen_data[, c("Sense", "Emma", "Sand1")]
X-squared = 14.274, df = 10, p-value = 0.1609

The chi-squared test statistic is 14.274 with 10 degrees of freedom.
The p-value of 0.1609 is greater than the common significance level of 0.05. 
This means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant difference in the word counts across the novels "Sense", "Emma", and "Sand1" (the parts of Sanditon written by Austen). In other words, based on this test, Austen appears to be consistent in her word usage across these novels.


1.4 c)

Test comparing Austen's chapters to the admirer's chapters:

        Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  austen_data[, c("Sand1", "Sand2")]
X-squared = 8.4993, df = 5, p-value = 0.1308

The chi-squared test statistic is 8.4993 with 5 degrees of freedom.
The p-value of 0.1308 is greater than the common significance level of 0.05.
This means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant difference in the word counts between the chapters of Sanditon written by Austen ("Sand1") and those written by the admirer ("Sand2"). In other words, based on this test, the admirer appears to have successfully imitated Austen's style in terms of word usage.
