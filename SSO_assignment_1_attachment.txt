1.1a)
The data is checked for normality by first showing a visual distribution of the data.
Here a histogram is used, in combination with a qqplot, 
in the qqplot the outliers seem to differentiate quite a bit but the rest is in a relatively straight line 
Then for conclusive meassurements a shapiro wilktest is produced with a high p-value. 
We conclude that the data is normally distributed

1.1b)
To make a confidence interval of 90% we first need to calculate sigma given that a two tailed sample is used
thus we check for 5 percent on each side (0.9 +0.05 +0.05 = 1)
Then we calculate the margin of error: ME = Zscore * (standard deviation of sample / squared root of sample size)
The margin or error is then substracted and added to the mean to create upper and lower bounds
Providing us witht he following range [2829.6 : 2996.9]

1.1c)
To test if the birthweight is bigger than 2800, we want to proof that its not smaller than or equal to 2800
H0 : point_estimate > 2800
H1 : point_estimate <= 2800
For a one tailed test we fill in the t.test function with the dataset, meaning it can already derive df and sd by itself
We conclude that the true mean is greater than 2800

1.1d)
The confidence interval differs since it does not have an end on the right side. This makes sense.
We want to confidentely say that the population mean is bigger than 2800 if the sample mean is above a certain number.
This number given the degrees of freedom a sample mean above 2829 gives us the confidence to say the population mean is above 2800.
Any value above that will definitely result in a population mean above 2829 and no upper bound is necessary, making the interval looking different

1.3a)
Both numerical and graphical summaries are found in the code 

1.3b)
By using a qq plot we get a visual indication that the humidity on the left is relatively well normally distributed. 
It is noticable that the outliers on the end differ from the straight line but in general it's fine
The temperature plot however appears to be not normally distributed. It is showing an s-shape.

1.3c)
[47.49 : 57.96]
When using the t.test method a couple of things happen. The sample mean (52.72) is compared with 0.
Obviously 0 is not the population mean and that is concluded by R as well. Then it shows a confidence interval
of 90%. This confidence interval entails that given the sample mean we can say with 90% certainty that the population mean is between 47.49 and 57.96

1.3d)
sample size n= (tscore/2 )^ 2 * standarddev^2 / E^2. E = margin of error = 0.02 over two tails devided = 0.01
t score is qnorm(alpha/2). When filling this is we will find the minimum sample size.
We see a sample size of 227, meaning that from 227 datapoints we can have a confidence interval with 95% such that length <= 2%
